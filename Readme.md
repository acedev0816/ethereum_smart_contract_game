#monopoly

This is a basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS Monopoly implementation. Up to eight players can play at once. If you're familiar with Monopoly, game play should be fairly self-explanatory. But if you have trouble, hovering the mouse over a control will usually display more information. Please report any issues you find.

New: Added capability to play against an AI. A AI for demonstration purposes only is included. A future update will include a more realistic opponent.
