#monopoly

This is a basic JavaScript/HTML/CSS Monopoly implementation I wrote from scratch. Up to eight human players can play against each other. If your familiar with Monopoly, game play should be pretty self-explanatory. But if you have trouble, hovering the mouse over a control will usually display more information. Please report any issues you find.
